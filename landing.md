## Video games

* ksp (Kerbal Space Program)

I've enjoyed [Kerbal Space Program][ksp-site] - shorthand **ksp** - since its launch (struggled, would be a better word) more than 10 years ago, but I have played it on and off on a number of occasions with long hiatus in betweeen.

## Board Games

I am a fan of regularly playing "Euro" style Board Games, generally light to mid/heavy weight games as ranked by the [BGG][bgg-site].

## Cinema

Directors like Tarantino, Nolan, Peele, Cuar√≥n, Scott, Spielberg - but also "classical" ones like Kurosawa, Leone, Bergman, Fellini.
      
## Music

Can't deny I'm a Jazz/Rock Fusion enthusiast with a soft spot for Funk, Soul and groovy beats. [Steely Dan][steely-dan] is the soundtrack I go back to more often than not.

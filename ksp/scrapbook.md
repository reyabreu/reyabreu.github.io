## Thoughts and notes about Kerbal Space Program

### Vessel Launch (Gravity Turns)
As shown by [Delta-V maps][delta-v-map], the estimated amount of Delta-V required by a vessel to reach a stable circular orbit around Kerbin at an altitude of 100km, stands at around 3400m/s (3431.03 m/s is the Escape Velocity). Please note that Kerbin's
upper atmosphere ends at 70km, after which it is considered "space" by KSP in this celestial body. Other celestial bodies with atmospheres (such as Duna) have different limits. Most interplanetary maneuvres are made from orbits
at orbits around 80, 100 or 120km at the most. As lower orbits are faster, to take advatnage of the Oberth effect, it is advised to launch from the lowest orbit possible for a given vessel's **TWR**(Trust To Weight Ratio).  

To be able to efficently use the vessel's fuel in reaching orbit, a vessel maneouvre called **Gravity Turn** is used that takes advantage of the celestial body rotation to assist additional Delta-V to the launched craft.  
In summary, if a craft is launched following the celestial body rotation (East in the case of Kerbin, following the 90ยบ line in the NavBall), the body provides additional mommentum, a slingshot effect that supplies Delta-V
to the vessel,

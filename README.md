# Reynaldo Abreu's Personal Website

I'm a Software Developer, Engineer with varied interests. I enjoy discussions around politics, the current state of affairs, science, technology, music, philosophy, and cinema amongst other topics.

I am also very much into gaming, both Board Gaming (the _new renaissance_ types) and Video Games.

## Video games

* ksp (Kerbal Space Program)
 I've enjoyed [Kerbal Space Program](ksp-site) - shorthand **ksp** - since its launch (struggled, would be a better word) more than 10 years ago, but I have played it on and off on a number of occasions with long hiatus in betweeen.

## Board Games

I am a fan of regularly playing Euro style Boad Games, generally light to mid/heavy weight games as ranked by the [BGG](bgg-site).

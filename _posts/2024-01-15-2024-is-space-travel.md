I've been looking at [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_in_spaceflight), looking to keep a more watchful eye over events that are happening in these times of renewed interest in Space.  
Very interesting ongoing missions like the [Chandrayaan-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandrayaan-3) being the first Lunar lander to touchdown near its South Pole, the failed [Peregrine Mission One](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=PEREGRN-1) which saw the first application of the Vulcan Centaur VC2 heavy lifter rocket, replacing the Atlas and Delta IV heavy rockets. In a couple of days, the [SLIM](https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/japan-slim-lunar-landing-spacecraft-9083169/) craft should be attempting its Lunar landing sequence.
All in all very exciting. I will be commenting more in future posts, and expanding more about Rocketry and Celestial Mechanics in the site.

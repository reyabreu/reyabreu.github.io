Few times I've been witness to such an amalgamation of public opinion and joint outcry as with this ITV docu-drama. I've binged in the 4 episodes ina  couple of days (as I'm sure most viewers have) and I'm aghast at teh story and the implications - still current and ongoing. This is a horror story for the common man/woman. More terrifying than any alien monster or paranormal ghoul hiding in the attic, because its something that happened in the UK, and I'm sure similar cases may have happened in other places with more lax approach to the rule of law.  

Gets you to think as well about our universal surrendering to the gods of automation in all aspects of our daily lives. We, as a species, have been very quick and eager to automate everything under the domain of the almighty microprocessor. In this new age of AI and sophisticated ML processes, we carelessly delegate processes and decisions that should be firmly rooted in the humane observation, to cold and efficient computers that will take milliseconds to be certain without nuance and full of biases. Most hauntingly, without an speck of doubt or mistrust in their own judgement. Those doubts that one expects from highly moral individuals. Individuals who will carefully weigh the consequences of bad decisions, as not only destroyers of the lives of others, but of their own souls. 

How can we expect the doubt that wisdom grants from a machine?

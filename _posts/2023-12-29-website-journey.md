I'm a Web Developer. Done backend for a long time, but curiosly never felt the imperative desire or need to have a web site of my own. Recently, I decided to change that after learning a bit more about [Github Codespaces][gh-codespaces] and [Github Pages][gh-pages].

It took me an evening of struggle with [Jekyll][jekyll-site] and the tools mentioned above, until I finally got something up and running. The idea of writing in [Markdown][markdown-site] is also appealing, as it removes much thinking about form - but rather the function of writing.

Hopefully, I won't stop here.

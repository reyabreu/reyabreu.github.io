I've been listening to several 80's classics from Alan Parson's Project in the car today, and was reminiscing about the days when I first listened to their classics, including: "Don't Answer Me", "Days Are Numbers (The Traveler)", "I, Robot" and "Eye in the Sky" amongst others. Was thinking of how much I miss the lyrical beauty of pop compositions from many different bands that were famous back in the day. How can one not be moved by the emotional depth of lyrics like:  

 "**_Don't answer me, stay on your island/Don't let me in/Run away and hide from everyone/Can you change the things we've said and done?_**"  

I'm always in the search for new music and performers, and I've found many incredible ones - bands like Jungle, Hyatus Kaiote, Toro e Moi, Jacob Collier, Miami Horror, Caravan Palace, etc. I remember when the radio gave us on its daily grid great songs that not only had great beats and tunes, but also well thought lyrics. 

Which is - at the risk of sounding like a grouchy old man - something that you don't see often nowadays.

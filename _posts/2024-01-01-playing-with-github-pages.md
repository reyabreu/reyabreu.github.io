I've been toying a bit more with [Jekyll][jekyll-site] and [Github pages][gh-pages], changing my workflow to use Github actions instead of the "branch deploy" I was using before. Nice.

Now I need to work a bit structuring my site so it makes more sense. I'll keep plodding along.

[gh-pages]: https://pages.github.com/ 
[markdown-site]: https://www.markdownguide.org/
[jekyll-site]: https://jekyllrb.com/
